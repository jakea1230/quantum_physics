                In the realm of quantum mechanics, the term "fundamental particles" refers to the elementary constituents of matter and forces that are not composed of smaller entities. These particles serve as the basic building blocks of the universe and are described by the Standard Model of particle physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fundamental particles can be broadly categorized into two groups: fermions and bosons. Fermions include quarks and leptons. There are six types of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom, as well as six types of leptons: electrons, muons, taus, and their corresponding neutrinos. Quarks combine in different ways to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. Leptons, on the other hand, are elementary particles like the electron that orbits the nucleus of an atom.

                Bosons are particles that mediate the fundamental forces of nature. The photon mediates the electromagnetic force, the W and Z bosons mediate the weak nuclear force, and the gluon mediates the strong nuclear force. The recently discovered Higgs boson, associated with the Higgs field, gives other particles mass. It should be stated that while gravity is one of the four fundamental forces, its corresponding particle, the graviton, is theoretical and has yet to be observed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The study of these particles and their interactions has not only deepened our understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe but has also led to numerous technological advancements and innovations. As research continues, the quest to uncover more about these particles and potentially discover new ones shapes the forefront of modern physics.
