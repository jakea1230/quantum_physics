                Waveâ€“particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that every particle or quantum entity may be described
                as either a particle or a wave. It expresses the inability of the classical concepts "particle" or "wave" to fully 
                describe the behavior of quantum-scale objects. As Albert Einstein wrote: "It seems as though we must use 
                sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other, while at times we may use either. We are faced with a new kind of 
                difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do."

                The idea of duality originated in a debate over the nature of light and matter that dates back to the 17th century when competing theories of light were proposed by Christiaan Huygens and Sir Isaac Newton. Experiments confirm that when measuring phenomena at the quantum level, particles can exhibit both wave and particle characteristics. This duality is a fundamental aspect of the nature of matter and energy in the quantum realm.

                Despite the challenges of reconciling the wave-like and particle-like behavior of quantum entities, wave-particle duality remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, guiding our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental levels.
